When I came to her appartment there was no one. I tried to ring the bell but nobody came: it was a call in the darkness that was her very own existence at that moment, an echoing sound in her little place that she used to call home but that recieved no answer, almost like a scream in the darkness with no one to rescue me, no one ready to take me under their wing and guide me trough the impending horror that was my life for the last few months. 
<br/>
As I said she wasn't there, and I wasn't there either: I was already wondering in the endless sea of possibilities that was her disappearance. I didn't want to force myself back into her life, whatever it was at the time, but I saw no other options for me, I was determined to find her and at least get an explanation, a warning, something would've been better than the emptiness that was driving me crazy. 
<br/>
I asked her neighbours but, unexpectedly, they didn't know much. She was like a phantom, a ghost that would end up living only in my dreams, or rather nightmares, fueled by her inexplicable departure.
<br/>
Her father was living in Boston: Harbourside Rd. 62, Marina Bay. A wealthy and cozy place, fit for someone of his leverage. It always struck me as funny that the condominums he was living in had a spelling mistake, they were missing an U and she always used to make fun of the owners. I've never been there, never felt such necessity and she actually never wanted to indroduce me to her family life: "More problems than anything" she loved to say, and even if I was mildly curious the circumstances never alligned for us to meet. Her mother was also an unknown factor, she never talked about her.
<br/>
So here was I, sitting in my car and pondering if I really wanted to take this trip, introducing myself with force into her family life, probably private for a reason: an unwanted guest into something that wasn't mine anymore. Actually it wasn't mine to begin with and I'd probably describe it as shared even though that's not a good term for that either. 
<br/>
Eighteen hours of mindless driving to get a somewhat unknown, probably harmful, result? For a moment I thought it wasn't worth it, it wasn't right. A moment later my foot was pressing on the pedal.
<br/>
The journey was uneventful and I arrived to Boston in the evening of the next day, after stopping in a motel on the road that smelled of chlorine and piss, but didn't have a swimming pool. The elderly woman that checked me in was super nice and even offered me a late dinner: I accepted it.
<br/>
And there I was, in front of that red door, one with a lot of scratches next to the keyhole and slightly worn out by the passing of time. Roxanne by the Police was coming from one of the balconies of the houses nearby as I pressed the doorbell: a gentle press, one that was unmissable but not insistent. After a couple of seconds I heard a hoarse voice coming from the apparatus, slightly distorted by the cables, interferences and analog-digital conversions it had to make to get to me.
<br/>
"Yes?"
<br/>
"Good evening, sorry to disturb you. I'm Jack. Esme's fiancee"
<br/>
I practiced this simple phrase for hours during the drive. I re-enacted all of the possible outcomes in my head and I was prepared to all of them, still, my voice came out crackling and insecure.
<br/>
"Second floor, the door on the right"
<br/>
Then the door opened with a buzzing noise.
<br/>
I wanted to ask so many things, I had questions upon questions in my head, not all relating to Esme, some of them just questions about her dad, his occupation, some of them even so obscure that I was sure he wouldn't know the answer to them, I had so many questions and at that moment I felt scared as someone that wasn't ready to know the truth, someone that tried to avoid this illogical moment for a very long time in his life, especially after she asked me to avoid it, and here I was, in front of one of many decisions in my life that led me to where I actually belong. I didn't want to know. What if it turned out to be a disappointment? 
<br/>
"Put on the red light"
<br/>
What if I just came to the conclusion that I actually was the problem. Those thoughts started accumulating in my head, dominating everything else, dominating my rational part of the mind, the one that actually was able to make sensible decisions. I remembered her. Actually no, I never forgot her to begin with, and she always was there, hidden in some recesses of my mind, sometimes obfuscated by other more pressing thoughts, but never completely gone, never completely absent. 
<br/>
"You don't have to put on the red light"
<br/>
That's why I decided to turn back. I wasn't ready to speak with someone else about it. I needed her. Nothing else. No one else. The door was open but for me it was a door in another loop of self deprecation so I turned and walked away. 
<br/>
"Put on the red light"
<br/>
So I started driving towards Boston, the center I mean. I had to find some other clues, I had to find her and not someone else, but I had no idea on where to begin. Probably some record of her past residences, maybe some tie-ins with her family, maybe some phone numbers registered to her name.
<br/>
I didn't know what to do but I, once again, started driving. Towards the lights of the city center, towards some clue that could lead me to her.
<br/>
Especially after the delusion that was not finding anyone at her father's home.
