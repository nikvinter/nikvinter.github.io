"You know what? You should really buy an hammock"
<br>
<br>
"A what now?"
<br><br>
"A hammock! You know, those th-"
<br><br>
"Yeah I know what an hammock is, but what for?"
<br><br>
"Well, they're cozy, you can lie down and think, listen to music, daydream"
<br><br>
"Oh ok I got it now, <i>you</i> want an hammock!"
<br><br>
She didn't answer but her eyes gave her away.
<br><br>
Two days later we had an hammock. 
<br><br>
We've been living together for over two years now. I really hate describing this part and I probably rewrote this at least three or four times; never finding the right words to describe how I felt at that time, mainly because good is an understatement but I'm bad with words, but also because as the time fades, bringing down memories with it, I remember less and less moments. 
<br><br>
I didn't have to work and neither did she: rich father, stuff like that. He had some funds invested in some offshore bank and she didn't really want to talk about it, shady stuff but I'm not someone that would complain about it. 
<br><br>
She moved in exactly five weeks and two days after that first call, bringing with her only a couple of clothes and a Yamaha CG102 with a small flower drawn with a sharpie on its shining body: stuff that I usually hate, in a completely irrational way, but this one was cool I had to admit. It's really ironic how I remember those small, little, insignificant details but her face is lost forever in the fog of my confusions. A fog that was born as a self-defense (other-defense?) mechanism because sometimes it's better to forget than to brood over things of the past, long forgotten and long due, irrelevant yet unexplicably relevant to our very own selves, like the memories of dead parents and friends, like the memory that I still have to this day, of my dying father, physically vivid and imprinted in my brain, one that I can't remove from there even if I tried times and times over, one that is detrimental to my conscious self and would be best eroded, erased, worn out. So why is the defense mechanism not working?
 <br><br>
Anyways I can recall only fragments of the whole. 
<br><br>
"Do you really think you will like it" I enquired?
<br><br>
"Yes" she answered with a pout while pressing the play button on the remote. 
<br><br>
The movie she chose was awfully boring, but she didn't want to admit it. We gave up halfway trough and mutually decided to ignore it, focusing on more important matters like trying not to knock out the vase my mother gifted to us when she learnt of Esme's moving.
<br><br>
Not every moment was happy, but it didn't have to be. I didn't believe in perfect relationships, and I wasn't looking for one at the time, hell I wasn't even looking for a relationship but this thing literally plummeted in my own open hands. 
<br><br>
"I really think you should be less of a musical snob and buy me the last Gaga's record" she teased me. I knew she wasn't serious, she didn't even like that album.
<br><br>
"Ok but it will be your birthay present. Do you agree with that?" I kept the farce 
<br><br>
"Awww... So no luxurious hotel and full body massage from a muscular therapist?"
<br><br>
"Oh yeah, I forgot our reservation for the one in downtown NYC"
<br><br>
"Mer mer mer, you're so boooring" she said while throwing a pillow at me. I evaded it.
<br><br>
We ended up not getting either. And not because we didn't want to, I think I actually bought her the Gaga vinyl as a joke and it's still sitting somewhere in my basement, never played, produced for a public that would never enjoy it, a soundtrack for the deaf.
<br><br>
All of it because she just vanished, five days before her birthday.
