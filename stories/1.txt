"Are you gonna keep staring at me for long?"
<br>
My head was phased out and I didn't even hear what she was saying, the sounds muffled in the distance like I was drowning in water. 
<br>
"Oh come on, now you're gonna pretend you're not even hearing me?"
<br>
Something snapped and my mind suddenly returned to the glass I was holding with my left hand, full of <u>god-knows-what</u>. Nevermind, I remember now, it was one of those cocktails that the usuals used to call <u>"girl's piss"</u>. Something something Beefeater with lemon syrup. Why did I even order that? I probably had a good reason behind that choice but for some reason it was locked behind shelves and layers of other thougths, swirling and swallowing everything like a steady but silent hurricane.
<br>
"Are you ok?"
<br>
Finally my eyes moved from the greasy counter and focused on the girl that was talking to me. I can't remember her lineaments now, records lost in time or overridden with other useless information, even though, now that I think about it, her look WAS useful information. Why did I forget? 
<br>
Her hair was short, that I remember. Not blonde, not artificially coloured. I remember thinking that she looked oddly out of place in that gloomy environment. Maybe it was her posture, or the way she was sitting on that chair. Or maybe it was something she was drinking, completely out of my memory but clearly unusual for someone of her portament. 
<br>
"What? Ahm... Yes, No, I'm sorry. Kinda lost myself there for a moment. Sorry if I was staring, didn't mean to"
<br>
"Oh it's all right. People usually do. Esme, by the way"
<br>
"Huh?"
<br>
"Esme. It's my name" she protruded her hand "Oh and before you ask, it's from Sallinger, not from Twilight. Not that young" she laughed. 
<br>
A laugh that I still remember echoing in me, reverberating and waking up everything in its path. I for a moment shifted all of my thoughts onto her name: not a usual one, but a clear literary reference for once. Still better than those Aryas running around nowadays. I myself was about to be named after a book, not sure my parents did it thoughtfully but Tom was a strong candidate. I actually don't ever remember my mother reading a book in her entire life, I probably saw her holding something resembling those in her hands a couple of times but I'm pretty sure those were instruction booklets, and I'm also pretty sure she did it only for the show; she never actually unserstood how to use that coffee machine I gifted her couple of years ago so I can still picture it standing there, on the marbe counter in the kitchen, never used, pristine and immaculate. Pristine and immaculate like the laughter of the girl I had in front of me whose hand was shaking mine. 
<br>
"Not a guy of many words? I guess I'll have to do the talking then. What brings you in this god forsaken place?" 
<br>
"I guess I could ask the same. Alcohol's cheap"
<br>
"Regular drinker?"
<br>
"Regular thinker"
<br>
"Oh so now it's the time where you quote Bukowski and tell me that that whatever-you're-drinking helps you with inspiration? By the way, what's that?"
<br>
"Not gonna quote anyone, didn't read him and not a fan of what i've heard, but the thing you said it's true, but I don't write. I just think, I like thinking and being immersed in my thoughts. And that is..."
<br>
I looked at the open door behind the counter and screamed into the dim light
<br>
"Hey man, what's that?"
<br>
Not recieving any answer I just shrugged it off.
<br>
"You still didn't answe me, what about you?"
<br>
The girl shifted a bit her position in the chair to look better at me, or maybe it was more comfortable for her sitting that way, who knows? I for sure don't know, and din't know at the time either. All of her gestures remained a mistery to me until the very last day, but I like to pretend, like probably a lot of people, that she did most of it for me. Not a very gallant thing to say, I know, but I've always been somehow of an eghoist, even if I didn't want to admit it. Who does? It's not our way of doing things: we just keep doing stuff pretending everything's all right and not noticing our delusions, shrugging them off, living a life that we pretend revolves around us, while ignoring the fact that we're not even a side character. 
<br>
"Not a very interesting story, I'm sorry. I was just passing by and decided I wanted a drink"
<br>
Lies. No one just "passes by" here. But I didn't care, I let it slide.
<br>
The music shifted. 8th place in the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2004, probably reminiscent of the new representation of the black culture of the 2000s in america buried by the almost complete leadership of artists by the likes of Jay-Z and Usher. Weird year the 2004, and the song was also weird for a bar like this: Hey Ya! - Outcasts. She seemed to not mind and started slowly moving her left feet following the tempo, probably subconsciously (or maybe overconsciously).
<br>
"Well, let me know you better then. Another one of that?" I said poiting at her almost empty glass "I really hope someone comes out of that door"
<br>
"No need to offer, I'll pay. But I appreciate. You still didn't tell me your name, is it a secret oh mysterious-gloomy-drinker?"
<br>
I could tell she had high expectations. She was expecting a Fitzgerald, or a Dorian, maybe even an Ovid (or maybe not, that probably would've been a turn off). Not sure where those expectations came from since my look wasn't even that prominent and slash or exquisite at all. And maybe my thought about her having those expectations was also wrong, but it didn't matter. We all believe what we want to believe. And as such I was sad to break her expectations.
