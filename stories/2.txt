The second time I met her was by chance. We didn't plan to hang up or anything and, even if the first time she gave me her number, I didn't call. Actually I was afraid of phones, not in a traditional sense, nothing like those radiation or elecromagnetic waves fellas. I just didn't like the thought of calling someone, it felt like an intrusion in that person's privacy, an intrusion in the time everyone leaves for themselves. I'm pretty sure there's someone out there that loves being called, but I wasn't one of them. 
<br>
<br>
So that phone never rang.
<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, we managed to find each other anyways. Destiny is blind but always find a way, probably not that hard when both parties go to the same bar at least once a week. Not sure if she started going there because of me or not, that I can't tell, but I don't remember her being there before meeting me. Not that it matters since I don't remember much anymore. 
<br>
<br>
The third time was a coincidence as well, but after that we kind of stopped faking it and officially organized a date. It wasn't a date per se but I guess going to the grocery store with her (since she didn't have a car) was close enough. 
<br>
<br>
My 2004 Mazda MPV wasn't certainly the best looking car but it always reminded me of the victory that japanese manufacturers had over the american ones. Even if that wasn't true I actually didn't care that much, my belief was aesthetically pleasing enough that I always found it worth having. All those japanese wares, made by people living in the woods, following traditions with a secular story behind them, with squiggly (and straight) lines representing moons, eyes and other stuff superimposed on the packages was fascinating to even think about. 
<br>

I didn't accompany her home that day. Not inside I mean. She insisted that I'd leave the bags next to the elevator and hugged me before suggesting me to leave. At the time I didn't get why; in hindsight it's obvious. 
<br>
<br>
The rain started as soon as I began driving away. The patterns on the windows looked like rapids and made me remember a story I heard somewhere. It was about a man who was lost in a jungle somewhere in South America if I recall correctly. He fell into a river, maybe he was shoved, I don't know. Point being that he started going downstream, pushed and pulled by the invisible forces of the water, crashing against rocks and tree stumps. 
<br>
<br>
He was about to give up. After what seemed like hours he was still trying to float using a big branch to keep himself up, his forces was abandoning him, and he was wondering if he realistically could've made it. There wasn't even a point in going out of the water because he didn't know where he was, with no food and with no equipment. Then, he heard an helicopter above his head.
<br>
<br>
What happened was that, a couple of hours prior, a DHC-6 Twin Otter was flying above the same river when an engine failure made the vessel crash into a lake nearby. Forces were deployed to find and rescue the survivors and the helicopter was part of them. 
<br>
<br>
Well, the guy reached the lake and was rescued. The passengers, on the other hand, didn't have so much luck: they all died during the impact. Imagine how surprised were the rescuers when the only guy they saved wasn't even on the plane.
<br>
<br>
I envied the man. Then I wondered why I was envying him for. 
<br>
<br>
The phone kept being silent. 
<br>
<br>
Since I was, how do we say that, in between jobs I had a lot of spare time. I was running short on money but that just meant no more coffee machines for a bit. And probably no more records, an expensive hobby. Luckily I had a vast collection waiting for me at home. No need for animals to jump on you when you open the front door, no need for a family. At least I didn't need them. I had my very own things stretching their hands at me and I valued my possessions, probably more than people, even if that's not something that you want to say out loud. 
<br>
<br>
I made myself some coffee and lowered the needle on the 1958's jazz-triumph-black's-victory-over-the-improvisation record "Somethin' Else". It probably had the best interpretation of Autumn Leaves I've ever heard and it always made me happy. I always associated it with my youth: we had one record player and my father used to listen to Adderley every Sunday. Not sure why but it was like a ritual, a call for prayer even if we weren't religious at all. Then the record player stopped playing. 
<br>
<br>
It was a Tuesday. Nothing ever happens on Tuesdays. Nothing happened on that Tuesday. 
<br>
<br>
The phone was as quiet as ever.
<br>
<br>
Then, five days later, it almost screamed.
